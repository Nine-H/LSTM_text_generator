# Machine Learning Text Generator

## Idea

I wrote a scraper for comments from pornhub, I want to feed them into a machine-learning AI to generate newer and sadder comments.

## Design

* I'm stupid so I'm going to skate over details by using Keras.
* Input will be a small dataset (1-50MB) of text catted together.
* I'm going to steal as much code as possible to get a works on my machine implementation.
* This is not gonna be super clean or pythonic or useful at all.
